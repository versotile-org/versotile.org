The [Versotile Programme][cc-vp] (in short: **Versotile**) was established within the
[Commons Conservancy][cc] in the summer of 2024.

Our main mission is to make the `Web` a better and safer place by developing new, unmonetized,
reliable and secure technology: primarily the [Verso browser](/verso).

### Join Us!

Needless to say, this project cannot thrive without community. If you are interested in the

The project would not be here without our main supporters:
