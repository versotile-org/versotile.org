## Introduction

While `Verso` is in the early stages of development (therefore it cannot be used for daily tasks) ...
it is imperative to understand: **why** it exists in the first place!

There are many browsers on the market already. Big ones, small ones, old ones, and new ones.
Although some of them have quite a nice purpose, similar to ours... they are often missing the real goal.

The `Web` nowadays is not really a free space.
We are far from what `Tim Berners-Lee` was trying to create:

> There are two clear, connected issues to address. The first is the extent of power concentration,
which contradicts the decentralised spirit I originally envisioned. This has segmented the web,
with a fight to keep users hooked on one platform to optimise profit through the passive observation
of content. This exploitative business model is particularly grave in this year of elections that could
unravel political turmoil. Compounding this issue is the second, the personal data market that has
exploited peopleâ€™s time and data with the creation of deep profiles that allow for targeted advertising
and ultimately control over the information people are fed.

(From the [open letter] he wrote for the 35th birthday of the `Web`)

Of course, there are more issues, and all of them are complicated to address.
We are offering a solution for a specific one: `browserland`.

## Purpose

As we mentioned, the Web is not quite free nowadays. It applies to web browsers even more.
And browsers are not just an important part of the whole "web thingy", but the gateway to access it.
It is the front face of the web, the essence of interacting with the web for the majority of the users.

What we see is the myriads of small browsers promising privacy, security, and other nice things...
they are mostly the same under the hood. Same technology, the same tech giant dictating the rules.

With that said, it means that the ecosystem is very easily influenced by them...
and recently we have seen that this is not always for the better.

To cut to the chase, we decided to counteract profit-driven web technology development and create
the concept of a **genuinely free and open, unmonetized, community-driven Web Browser Ecosystem**.

## Focus

While our browser could labeled as a "generic-use" browser, its main focus is on security and
privacy features. There is no strict policy at this stage of the development, but we aim to
protect users from the many threats out in the wilderness.

With the `security and privacy first approach`, we are also determined to stand against current invasive
data collection and advertising methods, and hinder their spread.

## Tech

**`Verso` is a web browser built on top of the `Servo` web engine.**
This is what you can read about Verso everywhere... but what it is really about?

[Servo] is the web engine that provides the many features Verso is using. We are heavily supporting
their work, as we are heavily relying on them.

So effectively we could say, that Verso is an abstraction over it, and it provides the user interface
and other features.
